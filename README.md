Hello! Welcome to Sports Trivia Central, here you'll be able to test out your knowledge of all things sports.

Follow this link to start the game! https://victorssportstrivia.netlify.app/

The idea for this quiz app comes from the classic jumbo tron quizes every sports teams has during a break at a sporting event. My idea was instead of only one fan being able to play, why not give the link to all fans in attendance and give everyone a chance to play! 


Instructions.

1. Upon initializing the game, the user will be taken to the main manu page. Here the user will be given 4 sports categories to choose from.

3. All categories consist of a 5 question quiz, each question being worth 20 points. 
4. At the end, the user will be told his score out of the possible 100 points. 
5. The home page will automatically come up shortly after finishing your last question from the previous quiz. The user will now have the option to try any of the 4 categories again as many times as they please.
