## **Introduction**
Hello! Welcome to <strong>Sports Trivia Central</strong>, here you'll be able to test out your knowledge of all things sports.

Follow this link to start the game! [link](https://victorssportstrivia.netlify.app/)

The idea for this quiz app comes from the classic jumbotron quizes every sports teams has during a break during the game to entertain the fans. My idea was instead of only one fan being able to play, why not give the link to all fans in attendance and give everyone a chance to play on their phones for a chance to win a price!


## **Instructions**

1. Upon initializing the game, the user will be taken to the main manu page. Here the user will be given 4 sports categories to choose from.

2. The user will then click on a category, and immideately be taken to their first quiz.

3. All categories consist of a 5 question quiz, each question being worth 20 points. 

4. At the end, the user will be told his score out of the possible 100 points.

5. The home page will automatically come up shortly after finishing your last question from the previous quiz. The user will now have the option to try any of the 4 categories again as many times as they please.

6. If the 60 second timer runs out before the user answers all 5 questions. A You Lose message will apear for 3 seconds before sending the user back to the main menu.

## **Languages**
1. Javascript 
2. CSS 
3. HTML

## **Wireframe**
For the wireframe I wanted to keep it simple. A quiz can be hard enough, there was no need for me to add too much and make it distracting for the user.

## **Next Steps**
1. Individually style each different quiz box. Depending on the category.
2. Add more questions to each category, making it much harder.
3. Add a high score section.
4. Clean up the code to make it much more concise
