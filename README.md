Hello! Welcome to Sports Trivia Central, here you'll be able to test out your knowledge of all things sports.

The idea for this quiz app comes from the classic jumbo tron quizes every sports teams has during a break at a sporting event. My idea was instead of only one fan being able to play, why not give the link to all fans in attendance and give everyone a chance to play! 


Instructions.

1. Upon initializing the game, the user will be taken to the main manu page. Here the user will be given 4 sports categories to choose from.
